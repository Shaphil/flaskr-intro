# Flaskr

Flaskr is a mini blog application that you are building following the official [Flask tutorial](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/tutorial/introduction/). The app essentially, will do the following things:

* Let the user sign in and out with credentials specified in the configuration. Only one user is supported.
* When the user is logged in, they can add new entries to the page consisting of a text-only title and some HTML for the text.   This HTML is not sanitized because we trust the user here.
* The index page shows all entries so far in reverse chronological order (newest on top) and the user can add new ones from       there if logged in.
